There are 3 mains properties of security in computer science, these can be summed up in the CIA triad which is as follows:

- Confidentiality: the outcomes of different actions in the system are only visable by authorised subjects.
- Integrity: actions modifying the system can only be performed by authorised subjects.
- Availability: subjects can perform all actions they are authorised for.

Each vulnerability has a lifecycle, this begins with the discovery of the vulnerability. After that there is then the disclosure (or not) to the system owner, the time between discovery and disclosure is called the black risk, after this comes grey risk, this is the time between disclosure and when the patch is released and distributed. And the time after the patch is called the white risk.

- Black Risk: Only discovery group aware.
- Grey Risk: Public is aware, but no patch is available.
- White Risk: Public should patch their system.
- Zero Day Exploit: Exploit available at time of disclosure.

## Exercise

Establish the vulnerability lifecycle for WannaCry and Stuxnet.

## STRIDE Model

This is a model designed by microsoft that assists with the classification of threats and is as follows:

- Spoofing: Eve logs in as Adam (Classic Eve)
- Tampering: Eve transfers money from Adam's account to hers
- Repudiation: Adam pretends Eve made a transfer instead of her
- Information Disclosure: Adam is able to see Eve's balance
- Denial of Service: Eve installs unknowingly a malware that wipes the phone
- Elevation of privilege: Adam is able to access God's account through his.
