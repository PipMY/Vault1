A random variable is a function that assigns a number to each outcome in the sample space of a random experiment, this can also be known as a stochastic variable.

We can say that a random variable $X$ is a discrete random variable if $X$ can take:
- only a finite number $k$ of different values $x_{1},\dots,x_{k}$.
- of an infinite sequence of different values $x_{1},x_{2},\dots$.

### Example 1

A coin is tossed twice, therefore the same space is $S=\{HH,HT,TH,TT\}$. Let $X$ represent the number of heads that come up.
