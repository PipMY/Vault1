This sub-module is assessed solely by a single piece of coursework. This coursework is a multiple choice test of 20 questions; 4 from each of these categories are as follows:

- Numpy
- Pandas
- Data Cleaning
- Data Analytics
- Visualisation

We have 1 hour for this exam and it's open book (I assume no AI though)

The content taught in this submodule is as follows:

We are also provided with self-control questions, these are to test our own understanding of the topic and cover things that were not covered in the lectures, we are strongly advised to solve the questions and send him the solutions for review, him being Dr. Igor Razgon.
